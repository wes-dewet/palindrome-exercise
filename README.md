# palindrome-exercise
Automated test for submitting a valid palindrome.

I used HtmlUnitDriver so that it could be run on any local machine and the tests will run in headless mode and will not need a specific browser to be installed in order to run.

I used TestNG parameterisation and keywords so that different palindrome inputs could be run, this is the simplest form of data-driven testing.
